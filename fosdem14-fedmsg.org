* The problem with distro infra
** Services are like people
Dozens of services, developed by many people

Each service has its own way of communicating with the rest of the world

Meaning that a service that needs to interact (yep, that's all of them) will need to implement a bunch of communication systems

** Debian infrastructure comms
[[http://ftp-master.debian.org/][dak]], our archive software, uses emails and databases to communicate. Metadata is available in a RFC822 format, no real API (the DB is not public either)

[[http://buildd.debian.org][wanna-build]], our build queue management software, polls a database every few minutes to know what needs to get built. No API outside of its database

[[http://bugs.debian.org][debbugs]], our bug tracking system, works via email, stores its data in flat files, and exposes a read-only SOAP API

SCM pushes in the distro-provided repos (on [[https://alioth.debian.org/][alioth]]) can trigger an IRC bot (KGB), some mails. No central notification mechanism

** Fedora infra before fedmsg

In the packaging pipeline: transition from service to service:

- Either done by a developer
- Or some ad-hoc hooks would trigger the next service in the pipeline

…

Not maintainable

Adding new services is annoying (you need to touch everything)

** Some kludges are available

#+REVEAL_HTML: <h4>UDD (the Ultimate Debian Database)</h4>

[[https://wiki.debian.org/UltimateDebianDatabase/][wiki page]]

Contains a *snapshot* of a lot *of the databases* undelying the Debian infrastructure at a given time (even some Ubuntu bits)

A lot of cron-triggered importers

Useful for distro-wide QA purposes, not so much for real-time updates

#+REVEAL: split

#+REVEAL_HTML: <h4>The PTS (Package Tracking System)</h4>

[[http://packages.qa.debian.org/]] (and [[http://pts.debian.net]])

Cron-triggered updates on source packages

Subscribe for *email updates* on a given packages

Messages not uniform, contain some headers for filtering and machine parsing

Not real-time

* A proposed solution: fedmsg
** What is fedmsg?

[[http://jkeating.fedorapeople.org/lfnw-messaging-2009.pdf][Jesse Keating's talk]] in 2009 at NorthWest Linux Fest

A *unified message bus*, reducing the coupling of interdependent services

Services subscribe to one (or several) *message topic(s)*, register *callbacks*, and respond to *events*

** What you get (almost) for free

- A stream of data representing the infrastructure activity (stats)
- De-coupling of interdependent services
- Desktop notifications for devs
- Live web dashboard of events
- IRC feeds ([[irc://irc.freenode.net/fedora-fedmsg][#fedora-fedmsg]] @ freenode, [[irc://irc.debian.org/debian-fedmsg][#debian-fedmsg]] @ OFTC)
- identi.ca and twitter accounts that get banned for flooding :-)

** fedmsg inception

First candidate: [[http://www.imatix.com/articles:whats-wrong-with-amqp][*AMQP*]]

[[./images/reorganize-amqp-j5.png]]

Issues:

- SPOF at the central broker
- brokers weren't very reliable

#+REVEAL: split

Actual message bus: [[http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all][0mq]]

[[./images/reorganize-0mq-overview.png]]

No broker, each service binds to a port and starts publishing messages

Other services connect to those ports and start consuming messages

Advantages

- No central broker
- 100-fold speedup over AMQP

#+REVEAL: split

Main issue with a brokerless system: *service discovery*

Three options

- Writing a broker (→ hello SPOF)
- Using DNS (most elegant solution)
- Distribute a text file

Fedora uses option #3, and the Debian GSoC student implemented option #2

* Using the bus
** Bus topology

[[./images/topology.png]]


** Message topics

Event topics follow the rule:

  org.distribution.ENV.SERVICE.OBJECT[.SUBOBJECT].EVENT

Where:

- ENV is one of *dev*, *stg*, or *production*.
- SERVICE is something like *koji*, *bodhi*, *mentors*, …
- OBJECT is something like *package*, *user*, or *tag*
- SUBOBJECT is something like *owner* or *build* (in the case where OBJECT is *package*, for instance)
- EVENT is a verb like *update*, *create*, or *complete*.

** Publishing messages

From python:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import fedmsg
fedmsg.publish(topic='testing', modname='test', msg={
    'test': "Hello World",
})
#+END_SRC

From the shell:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ echo "Hello World." | fedmsg-logger --modname=git --topic=repo.update
$ echo '{"a": 1}' | fedmsg-logger --json-input
$ fedmsg-logger --message="This is a message."
$ fedmsg-logger --message='{"a": 1}' --json-input
#+END_SRC

** Receiving messages

From python:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import fedmsg

# Read in the config from /etc/fedmsg.d/
config = fedmsg.config.load_config([], None)

for name, endpoint, topic, msg in fedmsg.tail_messages(**config):
    print topic, msg  # or use fedmsg.encoding.pretty_dumps(msg)
#+END_SRC

In the shell, you can use the fedmsg-tail command (demo time)

** Goodies

- All the stuff listed in [[What you get (almost) for free]] is implemented
- Cryptographic message signing: either via X.509 (Fedora) or GnuPG (Debian, implemented during GSoC13)
- Replay mechanism: detect if a message was missed (sequence id mismatch) and ask the sender for the remaining messages (implemented during GSoC13)
